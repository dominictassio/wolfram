## Wolfram

The Wolfram browser is an attempt to bring some of the features that the moblie
verion of chrome has that the desktop doesn't.

This is not a browser designed for heavy use and it's final form may still
contain breaking bugs. The idea is not to create a production ready browser but
to explore a more material themed chrome desktop browser.
